# EJS Partials

creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS
 so that we can take a look at how we can pass data from our Node + Express application to our views in the next section.

 Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.
